        index.html: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your test-site folder.

		What is local storage?

Local storage is a property for accessing a storage object, which is used to store and retrieve the data from the user’s Browser. It is accessible only at client side and not at Server side like a cookie.

The data stored in local storage is accessible. All the pages are under the same domain, unless the user does not delete it manually. Even though the user closes the Bowser, the data will be accessible next time.

    <p>
        XPath:  //*[@id="wikiArticle"]/p[10]/img
		<br />
		Storage capacity

Storage capacity for local storage and session storage varies based on the Browser. Generally, the Browsers provide around 5MB of storage space.
    </p>
    <p>
        JS path: document.querySelector("#wikiArticle > p:nth-child(23) > img")
		<br />
		What is session storage?

Session storage is almost the same as local storage. The only difference is, session storage will be cleared, once the user closes the Browser Window.
